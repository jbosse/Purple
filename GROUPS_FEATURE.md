# Group Codes Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Group Codes feature allows users to organize their OTP codes into custom categories, making it easier to find specific codes especially when managing many accounts across different contexts.

## Features

### 1. Custom Groups
- Create unlimited custom groups with meaningful names
- Assign icons to groups for visual identification
- Groups are sorted alphabetically in the UI

### 2. Default Groups
On first app launch, Purple OTP creates these default groups:
- **Personal** üë§ (Blue) - For personal accounts
- **Work** üè¢ (Orange) - For work-related accounts  
- **Development** üíª (Green) - For development/testing accounts
- **Production** üñ•Ô∏è (Red) - For production environment accounts

### 3. Group Assignment
- When adding new accounts, users can select a group or leave ungrouped
- Existing accounts without groups appear in an "Ungrouped" section
- Quick group creation available during account addition

### 4. Visual Organization
- Accounts are displayed grouped by their assigned group
- Group headers show the group name, icon, and account count
- Search functionality works across groups, service names, and account names
- Clean visual separation between groups

### 5. Group Management
- Access group management via the "Groups" button in the toolbar
- Create new groups with custom names and icons
- Delete groups (accounts are moved to "Ungrouped")
- View account counts per group

## User Benefits

### Problem Solved
Users previously had to scroll through many codes to find the right one, especially when:
- Not remembering how a code was originally labeled
- Managing both personal and work codes
- Handling multiple environments (Test, QA, Stage, Production)

### Solution Provided
- **Quick Organization**: Codes grouped by context/purpose
- **Easy Navigation**: Visual headers and icons for rapid identification  
- **Flexible Categorization**: Custom groups for any organizational system
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: No more scanning through long lists
- **Context Switching**: Easy separation of personal vs work vs environment codes
